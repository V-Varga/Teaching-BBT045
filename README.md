# Teaching-BBT045

Author: Vi Varga

Dates: 08.02.2023 & 14.02.2023


## Introduction

This is a GitHub repository for teaching materials prepared for Applied Bioinformatics (BBT045) at Chalmers University of Technology. Specifically, it contains the lecture slides, tutorial and exercise for the Phylogenomics portion of the course. 


## Repository Structure

The lecture slides can be found on the main page of the repository. 

All files necessary for the tutorial day can be found in the `Tutorial/` directory. The instructions for the exercise can be found in the PhyloTutorial.md file (and its PDF version).

All files necessary for the exercise can be found in the `Exercise/` directory. The instructions for the exercise can be found in the PhyloExercise.md file (and its PDF version).


## Instructions

For the tutorial: 
 - Complete the tree thinking exercise (Baum2005-TreeThinkingChallenge_ExerciseExerpt.pdf) in-class
 - Complete the phylogenomics tutorial (PhyloTutorial.md) in-class

For the exercise: 
 - Complete the exercise (PhyloExercise.md) on your own
 - Add a `PhyloExercise/` directory to your course GitHub repository, where you have been uploading your other homework assignments
 - Post your solutions in a Markdown file (or similar), as well as all necessary supporting files (e.g., JPEG images referenced in your Markdown solutions file) by the due date for the exercise: **23.59 on 17.02.2023**
 - If you have not already done so, remember to add me as a collaborator to your GitHub repository: https://github.com/V-Varga
 
Note that the exercise _is not mandatory_. If you choose to complete it, and hand it in before the given submission deadline, then I will look at your work and give you feed back on it. Either way, the exercise will not be for an actual grade - it is simply an opportunity for extra practice in phylogenomics, which is a topic that will be on your exam. 

Please also note that _I will not be uploading a document containing solutions to either this GitHub repository or to Canvas_. If you have questions about the tutorial or exercise, please contact me about them directly via e-mail or on Canvas.
